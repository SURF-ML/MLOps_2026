{"pid": "TCGA-VS-A959", "report": "The biopsy specimen from the cervix demonstrates a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm composed of atypical squamous cells. The tumor exhibits invasive growth with loss of cellular differentiation. No specific measurements are provided in the report. The lesion is confined to the cervix without evidence of distant spread."}
{"pid": "TCGA-S9-A6WL", "report": "The neuropathology report indicates a tumor with histological and morphological features characterized by increased cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity. The lesion demonstrates infiltrative growth patterns and moderate cellular pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining shows positivity for glial markers. Based on these findings, the tumor is classified as WHO grade III."}
{"pid": "TCGA-A8-A09C", "report": "The specimen shows a moderately differentiated invasive lesion measuring 2.2 cm in diameter, extending cranially to within 5 mm of the resection margin at 3 and 12 o'clock. No residual tumor is identified in the follow-up resection material. Sentinel lymph nodes are free of metastatic involvement. Histologic grade is G2. The surgical margins are tumor-free."}
{"pid": "TCGA-2H-A9GI", "report": "The specimen shows a moderately differentiated carcinoma arising in Barrett\u2019s epithelium, located in the distal esophagus. The lesion measures 4 x 3.5 cm. A total of 8 lymph nodes were examined, with 4 showing involvement. The resection margins are clear, indicating a radical resection. Cellular features include moderate differentiation with glandular architecture. Staging is based on tumor size and lymph node involvement."}
{"pid": "TCGA-AA-3952", "report": "The specimen shows an invasive, poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm arising in the colon, with extension through all layers of the bowel wall. Vascular invasion and lymphatic involvement are present. A total of 14 regional lymph nodes were examined, and six of them show evidence of tumor spread. The tumor is classified as high grade based on its cellular features. Staging parameters indicate advanced local invasion with significant nodal involvement."}
{"pid": "TCGA-AG-4001", "report": "The resected colon specimen from the rectosigmoid region demonstrates tumor-free oral and aboral resection margins. An ulcerated lesion is present, characterized by moderately differentiated cellular features. Histological evaluation shows infiltration into the perimuscular fatty tissue. No involvement of local lymph nodes was identified, with a total of 29 lymph nodes examined. Vascular invasion is absent. The lesion exhibits a histologic grade consistent with moderate differentiation."}
{"pid": "TCGA-AN-A0FX", "report": "Female patient underwent radical mastectomy for tumor excision. Histological evaluation revealed a high-grade neoplasm with features of metaplastic differentiation. The tumor was located in the left breast and classified as a primary lesion. Pathologic staging showed T stage 2, N stage 0, M stage 0. No prior treatment was administered. A normal blood sample was collected via blood draw and stored frozen for analysis."}
{"pid": "TCGA-IG-A3YA", "report": "The esophageal specimen measured 3 x 3 x 1.2 cm and showed a moderately differentiated cellular growth pattern. The deepest extent of the lesion involved the adventitia. No regional lymph node metastases were identified out of four examined. Lymphatic or venous invasion could not be confirmed. Surgical margins were free of abnormal cells. There was no evidence of prior treatment effect. No additional findings were reported."}
{"pid": "TCGA-EB-A42Z", "report": "The surgical resection specimen from the skin measured 3 x 3 x 1 cm and exhibited ulceration with pigmentation. Microscopic evaluation revealed poorly differentiated tumor cells. The Breslow depth was measured at 10 mm. Of the 10 lymph nodes examined, one from the right inguinal region showed evidence of metastatic involvement. No definitive assessment was made regarding lymphatic or venous invasion, satellite nodules, surgical margins, or prior neoadjuvant treatment."}
{"pid": "TCGA-86-8358", "report": "Specimen consisted of a lobectomy with tumor located in the lung measuring 3.2 x 3.2 x 3.2 cm. Microscopic examination revealed poorly differentiated cells. A total of six regional lymph nodes were examined, and none contained metastatic involvement. Additional features including tumor extent, presence of other nodules, lymphatic or venous invasion, margin status, neoadjuvant treatment effect, and other findings were not specified. The laterality was noted as right-upper."}
